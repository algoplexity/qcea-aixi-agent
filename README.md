**The Reflective Physicist: Operationalizing Universal Artificial Intelligence in Entropic Financial Environments.**

### 🌌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an autonomous financial agent built on the intersection of two foundational theories:
1.  **Universal Artificial Intelligence (AIXI):** The agent maximizes expected future reward by learning a **Universal Prior** over computable environments (Hutter, 2005).
2.  **Quantum-Complex-Entropic-Adaptive (QCEA) Theory:** The agent preserves **Strategic Coherence** against entropic decay by adapting its "Internal Clock" and "Wingspan" to the mixing time of the landscape (Williams, 2025).

### 🧠 The Architecture: A Cybernetic Loop
Unlike standard RL agents that memorize historical prices ("Stochastic Parrots"), the QCEA-AIXI agent operates through a **Reflective Cybernetic Loop**:

1.  **SENSE (The AIT Physicist):** A Transformer pre-trained on the **Wolfram Computational Universe** collapses the market superposition into a topological state (e.g., Rule 54 Solitons vs. Rule 60 Fractals).
2.  **INFER (The Reflective Gate):** A Bayesian Gating Network dynamically weights an ensemble of experts (Newtonian Inertia vs. Boltzmann Entropy) based on the detected physical regime.
3.  **ACT (Entropic Regulation):** The agent outputs a probabilistic forecast $(\mu, \sigma)$, actively managing its own uncertainty budget to survive tail risks.
4.  **LEARN (Self-Modification):** The agent updates its own neural weights in real-time (Online Learning), adhering to the principle that **Survival is a Precondition for Optimization**.

### 📂 Repository Structure
*   **`submission.py`**: The standalone agent for the CrunchDAO Falcon competition.
*   **`models/`**: Contains the frozen `trm_expert.pth` (Sensor) and pre-trained `reflective_gate.pth` (Mind).
*   **`notebooks/`**:
    *   `01_H2_The_Data_Foundry`: Generating the "Nightmare Mode" theoretical benchmark.
    *   `02_H2_The_Spatial_Encoder`: Training the Universal Prior (Sim-to-Real transfer).
    *   `03_H2_The_Falcon_Gauntlet`: Benchmarking against NGBoost (The Victory).
    *   `04_H2_The_Cybernetic_Loop`: Auditing the internal tensors of the decision cycle.

### 📊 Data Provenance
The agent is trained and validated on the **QCEA Adaptive Agent Benchmark**, hosted immutably on Hugging Face:
