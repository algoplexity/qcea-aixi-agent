**The Reflective Physicist: Operationalizing Universal Artificial Intelligence in Entropic Financial Environments.**

This repository contains the official implementation of the **Horizon 2** initiative of the [Algoplexity Research Program](https://github.com/algoplexity/algoplexity). Its mission is to solve the problem of **Action**, engineering an adaptive agent that can navigate the "Dancing Landscape" of complex financial markets.

## 🧠 The Architecture: A "Thinking, Fast and Slow" Synthesis

The central challenge of real-world agency is the **tyranny of the clock**—the need for millisecond-level reaction times that makes slow, deliberative reasoning (the ideal of AIXI) computationally infeasible. To solve this, we have engineered a novel, **Dual-Process Cognitive Architecture**, directly inspired by Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow."

### **System 1 (Fast): The Homeostatic Agent (The "Spinal Cord")**

This is our tactical, sub-cognitive agent designed to win the 50-millisecond dogfight. It solves the problem of **Bounded Rationality** through a **Reflective Cybernetic Loop**:

1.  **ACT (Entropic Regulation):** The agent outputs a probabilistic forecast $(\mu, \sigma)$, actively managing its own uncertainty budget.
2.  **LEARN (Self-Modification):** The agent monitors the log-likelihood of its own predictions, measuring its internal state of "pain," as validated in our [Horizon 0 "Somatic Marker" study](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5914102).
3.  **REGULATE (Homeostasis):** Based on this pain signal, it continuously adjusts its **`gamma` ("Panic Factor")**—an adrenaline response that modulates its risk tolerance in real-time. This ensures **Survival is a Precondition for Optimization**.

### **System 2 (Slow): The AIT Physicist (The "Prefrontal Cortex")**

This is our strategic, meta-cognitive observer, designed to understand the changing "weather of the war." It solves the problem of **Non-Stationarity** by perceiving the market's underlying computational state.

1.  **SENSE (The AIT Physicist):** A **Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)**, pre-trained on the Wolfram Computational Universe as detailed in our [Horizon 1 "Cognitive EEG" paper](https://github.com/algoplexity/computational-phase-transitions), acts as the Observation Operator. It collapses the market's state superposition into a tractable topological state (e.g., Rule 54 Solitons vs. Rule 60 Fractals).
2.  **INFER (The Reflective Gate):** A Bayesian Gating Network dynamically weights an ensemble of internal experts based on the diagnosed physical regime from the AIT Physicist.

### **The Synthesis**

The two systems are integrated. The "slow" System 2 provides strategic context by sending **meta-policy directives** to the "fast" System 1, adjusting its baseline parameters to align its tactical reactions with the broader strategic reality.
